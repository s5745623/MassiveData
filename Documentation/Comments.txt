Your propose to analyze the NYC Taxi dataset to determine where NYC taxi dataset to see where drivers can make more money. Your proposal clearly indicates the anticipated time-table and who is responsible for each task. Your proposal to divide the group of passengers into those who tip and those who do not may run into problems. What is the difference between driving in a region where 100% of the passengers tend to tip $10 and driving in a region where 50% of the passengers tip $20? It seems that would increase the variance but not change the expected outcome. Will you be modeling how much money taxi drivers in general are making, or will you be modeling specific drives? The NYC taxi database allows you to tease out individual trips by taxi driver. That would allow you to look at the issue of competition, which is missing from your proposal. Specifically, a taxi is better going to a location where one can reliably get $20 fares, rather than moving to an area where there are so many other taxies that one has to wait for an hour to get $50 fares. So you may wish to model the utilization of each taxi in different regions of the city. How will your work be validated? How will you know that your findings are correct? Why should people trust the findings? One way to validate the model would be to do a monte carlo simulation of taxis driving around the city, and then you could see if your virtual taxi can get or not get the fares. Overall, this is a good start, but you need to do a better job planning what you actually want to do. You can do that planning now, or you can do it while you are in the throes of the project. We recommend that you do it now, while there is time to think everything through and evaluate your course of action. You do not need to resubmit your proposal.
